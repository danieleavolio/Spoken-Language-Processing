32. Initially extract feature like MFCC and then use a GMM to for every language. It's possible to apply some post processing like calculation of delta or doulbe delta, or as suggested silence removal. Then, the GMMs are used to classify the language of the test data. The problem is that it works only on the acoustic level, and it's not able to understand the meaning of the words.
33. Sparrow is a particular q&a system that is trained on following a specific set of rules with human feedback, based on the correctness of the answers and the ability to respect the rules. It can run search queries to return the sources for the answer. Our system was a more general chat system that used ASR for the speech recognition and tts to generate the asnwer in voice.

Beh, 1 sbagliata su 33 è un buon risultato.

Contando che 0.5 per risposta esatta e -0.25 per risposta sbagliata, ho 0.5*32 - 0.25*

32. The x-vector is a particular type of model that is used in speaker recognition. It's trained using a DNN and backpropagation. The x-vector uses frame level features and at some point there is a pooling layer. THe embedding that comes out contains information about the speaker. Then on top of this embedding is possible to train a classifier to recognize the speaker. 
33. LLM compared to modular task oriented systems try to emulate the behaviour of the models without actually using specific modules. A LLM is trained on a large corpus of text and generates output based on the textual prompt that is given in input. The modular task oriented systems generates output based on the specific modules that are present in the system. The LLM is more flexible and can be used for a wider range of tasks, but it's also more difficult to train and to understand how it works.
